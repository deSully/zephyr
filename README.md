# Zephyr

**Zephyr** is a Python library designed for intelligent cache management. It dynamically adjusts the Time-to-Live (TTL) of cached entries based on metrics such as latency, request volume, and error rates.

## Purpose

Zephyr aims to simplify and optimize caching by automating manual decisions and enhancing overall API performance. Its eco-design principles help minimize resource usage by adapting the cache to real-world application behavior.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Automatically determines TTL based on observed metrics.
- **Flexible Integration**: Easily integrates with Redis and other caching backends.
- **Intelligent Strategies**: Supports user-defined rules based on specific parameters.
- **Eco-Friendly**: Reduces redundant API calls and optimizes resource usage.

## Why Choose Zephyr?

Zephyr stands out by offering an automated and intelligent approach to caching, reducing maintenance overhead while boosting system efficiency. Itâ€™s the ideal solution for developers who prioritize both performance and sustainability.


## Running Zephyr with Docker

To quickly get started with Zephyr, you can run it using Docker. Follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   Ensure you're in the project directory, then build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8097:8097 --name zephyr-container zephyr

    ```
